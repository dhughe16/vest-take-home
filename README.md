This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# [Click here for live demo](https://vest-take-home.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, install the packages with `npm i`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing

In order to test, we will need to use Babel. This is due to a mistake I made when configuring the project where I used Turbopack instead of Babel. Until I fix the project to use Babel, you must rename the file to run tests, then change the name back to run in development mode.

# Rename the file `.babel.config.js` to `babel.config.js`, removing the `.`. 

Run `npm run test`.

I have not included testing beyond making sure data displays as I am not performing any transformations on the data received in the json. Once a backend is connected, I would like to add more tests to ensure that data is received and displayed as expected.

## UX Principles/Tufte's Laws Used

- Law of Proximity - group items with a similar use together
  - Group text into categories of similar topics
- Tesler's Law - hide complexity where possible, but don't eliminate detail
  - Used accordion to hide some holdings information
- Miller's Law - people can only hold 7Â±2 items in working memory, so chunk data into digestible groups
  - I used cards and grouped text to prevent overload.
- Von Restorff Effect - unique items are more likely to be remembered
  - Call to Action buttons are the only orange items on the page
- Chartjunk - don't overload charts with gradients, effects or irrelevant icons
  - The chart does not use any gradients. The only effects are to hide and show the data points, which are hidden until mouseover for additional cleanliness.

## Design Note

This project was made within a limited amount of time. As such, it was styled mobile first and I did not have time to style for desktop.

## Next Steps

1. First and foremost I'd like to continue work on the Holdings Summary page. I like the format of using a dropdown to switch between different holdings, but I feel that graphics and charts would make the page much more engaging. Some ideas:

  - Separate different pieces of data into their own cards
  - A chart to replace the current values and shares details accordion.
  - Add icons to match different pieces of data.

2. Add a dummy backend to better represent the way data will be passed to the application.

3. Test the connection and assumptions made around a dummy backend.

## Recent Changes - 8-29-25

- Move symbol summaries to porfolio performance (home) page.
- Allow multiselect of symbols so they can be compared.
- Separate legacy symbol summary page will remain for the moment in case it is needed for future reference.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
